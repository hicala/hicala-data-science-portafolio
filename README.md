Greetings, I am Hila (Hilario) Calderon.

I love using statistics and machine learning to solve and visualize practical analytics problems by incorporating predictive models. In summary, I am acting as a Data Translator and Data Interpreter to support the Insgiht storytelling from dissimile raw data sets. I'm also <em>really</em> into sailing, 360ยบ video-photography, and 3D modelling, creative writing and teaching. I love sports between other hobbies as well, with the change of seasons.

This repository is containing a summary portfolio of some of data science projects completed by me during my professional career for government, academic, NGO, or for some self-taught, autodidactic, self-educated, self-instructed purposes. 

All the projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, MATLAB & Simulink and R markdown files.

Check out [personal portfolio](http://www.hilacalderon.com) for a more visually gratifying  journey through the browsing of the portfolio,
